### Basic Website
***
While taking a course on HTML5 and CSS3 through The Tech Academy of Portland, I was instructed to create a basic website using both HTML and CSS. Utilizing Aptana Studio, I constructed and styled a 3 page website with audio, video, and image files. During a later course on JavaScript, I returned to this basic website and added some jQuery functionality by adding a drop-down hover menu on the sidebar of all 3 webpages. I also added LightBox effects to all the images and videos on the website as well.
