# TTA Course Work

A collection of work done for a variety of courses taken through The Tech Academy of Portland. 

Note: Some content in the "Drills" Directories is not my original work, but code copied while watching video tutorials or reading textbooks to better familiarize myself with the programming languages. All content in the Projects Directory is my own.
