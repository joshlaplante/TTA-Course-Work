# TTA-Course-Work

A collection of work done for a variety of courses taken through The Tech Academy of Portland. 

Note: Content is not my original work, but work copied while watching video tutorials or reading textbooks
to better familiarize myself with the programming languages. Original work can be found [here](https://github.com/joshlaplante/portfolio-for-JoshLaPlante)
