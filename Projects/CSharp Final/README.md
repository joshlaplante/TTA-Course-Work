### C# Final Project
***
##### Challenge:
At the end of a course on C# and ASP.NET offered by The Tech Academy of Portland, I chose to create a C# console application using a code-first approach to Entity Framework

##### Action Taken:
I first familiarized myself with Entity Framework's code-first methodology by seeking out tutorials and guides online. I then used Visual Studio to define C# classes that would become tables within a database, define the database context, and populate the database tables. I then designed a console application that allows the user to interact with the database and pull requested information by the usage of LINQ queries. 

##### Result:
While simple, my application runs smoothly and introduced me to designing databases code-first. The database itself contains characters from my favorite video game, Super Smash Bros. 64, as well as each characters' special attacks in the game. In the application, the user is presented with the character list, and upon selection of a character name, the list of attacks for that character is returned. This project was a great learning experience and I will surely use the Entity Framework alongside .NET in the future.
