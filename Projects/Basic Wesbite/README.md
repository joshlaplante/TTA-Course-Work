### Basic Website
***
##### Challenge:
While taking a course on HTML5 and CSS3 through The Tech Academy of Portland, I was instructed to create a basic website using both HTML and CSS. 

##### Action Taken:
Utilizing Aptana Studio, I constructed and styled a 3 page website with audio, video, and image files. During a later course on JavaScript, I returned to this basic website and added some jQuery functionality by adding a drop-down hover menu on the sidebar of all 3 webpages. I also added LightBox effects to all the images and videos on the website as well.

##### Result:
The website, while extremely simplistic, is easily navigable and features some of my favorite music projects and images I've taken. Moreover, I can use this project and the experience I gained while working on it as a foundation for future websites I create.
