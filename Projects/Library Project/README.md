### Library Project
***
##### Challenge:
While taking a course offered by The Tech Academy of Portland covering Databases and SQL, I was challenged to create a database that would simulate a library system and then make queries to retreive specific data. 

##### Action Taken:
Using SQL Server 2008 R2, I wrote a script to create and populate tables with data to represent the library's branches, books, customers, and outstanding book loans. I then tackled a set of problems posed to return specific information by running queries on the database.

##### Result:
All seven queries return the desired information. Furthermore, I learned how careful you must be syntactically when working in SQL. While I was attempting to populate my tables with data I kept receiving errors and could not locate the problem. Finally, after many cups of coffee, I spotted that the error was due to one comma being out of place in a massive field of entry data. My takeaway from this is that computers are inifinitely obedient, patient, and unfortunately stupid, as they can only do exactly what you tell them to. I must learn to be just as patient in my debugging practices and more aware of syntax in future projects.
