### Simple Log-In Form
***
##### Challenge:
While taking a course on HTML5 and CSS3 through The Tech Academy of Portland, I was instructed to build a user log-in form.

##### Action Taken:
Utilizing Aptana Studio, I created and styled fields for email and password entry and placed them over a sleek background image.

##### Result:
While currently the log-in form has no functional purpose, it is beautiful and simple and I could easily apply it to a website I create in the future.
