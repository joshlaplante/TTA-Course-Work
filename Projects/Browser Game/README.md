### Browser Game
***
#### Challenge:
While taking a JavaScript Course through The Tech Academy of Portland, I challenged myself to create a simple web-browser game by combining some basic HTML and CSS with jQuery functionality. 

#### Action Taken:
I utilized Aptana Studio to first design the HTML layout of the single-page game, then style it using CSS. Lastly I added some jQuery animation functions to create a simple game structure.

#### Result:
The result is a game in which a player tries to find a star hidden in a field of boxes that animate their CSS properties as the player's mouse hovers over them. Basic, for sure, but it should work in all desktop web browsers.
