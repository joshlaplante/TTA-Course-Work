### Music Player GUI
***
##### Challenge:
While taking a course on Python through The Tech Academy of Portland, I was tasked with creating a basic GUI with some functionality 

##### Action Taken:
Working with Python 2.7's wxPython package, I designed a GUI that would allow users to open a song of their choice and then playback and display the title of that song. Each of the three preloaded songs also populates the GUI with a unique image, which the user can remove if they wish. 

##### Result:
While I had trouble getting wxPython's Media Control widget to display its controls, I was able to create and style my own buttons to open, play, and pause the song chosen by the user. I am pleased with the funtionality of the GUI and the fact that it features my own personal music creations.
